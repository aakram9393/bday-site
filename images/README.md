## Tips for Great Hint Photos

### Option 1: Subtle Hints
- Take a photo of the general area without showing the exact hiding spot
- Example: A photo of the living room with the couch visible
- This makes it more of a fun treasure hunt!

### Option 2: Clear Arrows
- Take a photo and add arrows pointing to the location
- Use your phone's photo editor or apps like:
  - **Markup** (iPhone built-in)
  - **Snapseed** (free app)
  - **Canva** (free online editor)

### Option 3: Zoomed Out View
- Show the room from a distance
- Let her figure out where to look

### Option 4: Mystery Angle
- Take photos from interesting angles
- Make it a fun guessing game
